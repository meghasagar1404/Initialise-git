<h1>Ethymology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    The noun markup is derived from the traditional publishing practice called<b> "marking up" </b>a manuscript,[3] which involves adding handwritten annotations in the form of conventional symbolic printer's instructions â€” in the margins and the text of a paper or a printed manuscript.
    <br>
    <br>
    For centuries, this task was done primarily by skilled typographers known as "markup men"[4] or "markers"[5] who marked up text to indicate what typeface, style, and size should be applied to each part, and then passed the manuscript to others for typesetting by hand or machine.

    The markup was also commonly applied by editors, proofreaders, publishers, and graphic designers, and indeed by document authors, all of whom might also mark other things, such as corrections, changes, etc.
